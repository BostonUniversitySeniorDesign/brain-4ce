# Firmware Configuration

OpenBCI really does not want their design to used with a wired connection. From forum posts it is clear that their main motivation for this is safety as a battery connection has finite charge and a smaller discharge rate making the results of a potential hardware malfunction less dangerous. Unfortunately the way they designed this required functionality of less popular hardware in order to transmit data which ultimately fell into deprication. In order to make a design that is more robust to time our team opted for a wired hardware connection. This means bypassing safe gaurds put into place make implementation of a wired connection not possible by default.

In terms of firmware the largest difference is the datapacket transformation done betweem the openbci cyton and the dongle. The start bit from the cyton is transmitted as `'A'` which is then converted to `0xA0` in order to be within their datapacket spec found [here](https://docs.openbci.com/Cyton/CytonDataFormat/#binary-format). In order to rectify this we edited the macro `OPENBCI_BOP` found in [OpenBCI_32bit_Library_Definitions.h](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Cyton_Library/blob/master/OpenBCI_32bit_Library_Definitions.h#L19) from `'A'` to `0xA0` and made a [patch](packet.patch) in order to bypass this restriction.
